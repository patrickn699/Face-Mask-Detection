As the number of photos for training and testing are little less so the accuracy may vary,
also please contribute for gathering more photos as it will help other developers as well and grow as a community,
happy coding.

1)you can directly run the "Detect Mask.ipynb" as the model is pre-trained.
2)If you want to improve the model then use "Face Mask.ipynb".
3)you will require some important packages like Keras,Tensorflow(I have used v-2.0.1),Sklearn,OpenCV,Numpy.
4)If you are having a GPU then training time is decreased.
5)Download dataset from-Mega--> https://mega.nz/folder/6Go30ZSI key--> ybYblsiM7S4jYskFUqmD8g
